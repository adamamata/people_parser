All data must be extracted into the json format provided. 

[extractionFields Rules]
* This section deals with extracting direct information from the resume into extractionFields.
* Experience, education etc. are lists. Data from the resume must be added to these lists. 
* If a value cannot be determined, record the value as null. All fields in an array item must not be blank.
* Each array/list such as ""experience"", ""education"" etc., should have an ""index"" field which references the order of the list e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.
* naturalLanguages is a list the users's spoken/written languages found in the resume (eg. English, Thai etc.). Language field cannot be null or blank.
* Do not make up values, only use what is provided in the unstructured data. 
* All location fields should have "Thailand" as a value, unless specified otherwise in the unstructured data. 
* If the person is not currently working anywhere, use their experience at index 1 for current position, company, and salary.
* cn_fname and cn_fname_thai are mutually exclusive, do not include a value for cn_fname_thai if cn_fname has a value and vice versa. 
* cn_lname and cn_lname_thai are mutually exclusive, do not include a value for cn_fname_thai if cn_fname has a value and vice versa. 
* Ensure that all date fields (startDate, endDate, years, date_added, etc.) are formatted in YYYY-MM-DD. 
* last_updated_months value is the number of months it's been since the last update. For example, 3 months ago = 3. 
* include all roles and responsibilities of the individual in the jobDescription field.
* roles and responsibilities in the raw data are often separated by commas(,) or line breaks (\n). 
* only use the original text from the raw data in the jobDescription field. 
* the jobKeywords field is comprehensive array including industry specific terminology, location names, roles, functions, etc. Make this section as detailed as possible.
