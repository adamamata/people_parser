[extractionFields Rules]
* This section deals with extracting direct information from the resume into extractionFields.
* Experience, education etc. are lists. Data from the resume must be added to these lists. 
* If a value cannot be determined, record the value as null. All fields in an array item must not be blank.
* Each array/list such as ""experience"", ""education"" etc., should have an ""index"" field which references the order of the list e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.
* naturalLanguages is a list the users's spoken/written languages found in the resume (eg. English, Thai etc.). Language field cannot be null or blank.
* Do not make up values, only use what is provided in the unstructured data. 
* All location fields should have "Thailand" as a value, unless specified otherwise in the unstructured data.
